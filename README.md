Welcome to Math attack
- this a game where you create a name and attack other players using your math skills!
- to gain health and damage another player, click on their name to answer a math question.
- The difficulty of the question depends on the health of the player you are attacking. The higher the health, the harder the question!
- once your health goes to 0 you can create another name and play again!
